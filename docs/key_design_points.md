### Key Design Points in SecureStore.cpp:

- Initialization (SecureStore constructor):
    - Validates paths.
    - Creates the root storage directory.
    - Initializes KeyProvider and Encryptor.
    - Derives and stores a m_masterKey. If any of these steps fail, m_initialized remains false, and operations will fail early.

- validateDataId: A crucial (though simple here) method to prevent data_id from being misused for path traversal or creating invalid filenames. Production systems might need more robust validation (e.g., regex for allowed characters).

- storeData Backup Strategy:
    - Encrypts data.
    - Writes to a temporary file (e.g., id.enc.tmp) using FileUtil::atomicWriteFile (which itself writes to .tmp.tmp then renames to .tmp).
    - If a main_file (e.g., id.enc) exists:
        - Delete old backup_file (e.g., id.enc.bak) if it exists.
        - Rename main_file to backup_file.
    - Rename the temp_file (now id.enc.tmp) to main_file.
    - This ensures that there's always either a valid main_file or a backup_file (or both) if the operation is interrupted. The temporary file stage ensures the target files (main_file, backup_file) are not corrupted during the actual encryption writing.

- retrieveData Resilience:
    - Tries to read and decrypt the main_file.
    - If that fails (read error, file not found, decryption/authentication error), it tries the backup_file.
    - If data is successfully retrieved from the backup_file, it attempts to restore this (still encrypted) data back to the main_file location using FileUtil::atomicWriteFile. This "heals" the main file.

- File Naming: Uses consistent extensions (.enc, .bak, .tmp).

- Error Handling: Propagates errors using Error::Errc and logs extensively using SS_LOG_* macros.
